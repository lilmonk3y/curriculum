# About me


I'm a web developer with a strong back-end background and a growing passion for front-end development. My main focus is building effective and adaptable software in agile, dynamic environments where changing requirements drive user value. My experience includes working at Fintech and Adtech companies. Proficiency in English has enabled me to collaborate seamlessly with teams in the United States and Israel.

The biggest number of challenges I faced professionally were in back-end web architectures, where I worked with a very wide range of programming languages and frameworks, the main ones being Java with VertX, PHP with Laravel, and JavaScript with Node. In system designs, I worked with both microservices and monoliths, and for databases, I utilized SQL, Key-Value stores, Couchbase, and Elasticsearch. I believe that we have to design systems that give our users the best experience, but are also easy to understand and maintain. 

Recently, I have started taking on new challenges in front-end projects to expand my expertise beyond back-end development. My goal is to become a versatile developer, able to contribute to projects from design through implementation, with strong consideration for user experience and performance.

# Education 

## Computer Science @ University of Buenos Aires

From 2015 - Until 2024.

The degree gave me a very solid foundation in mathematics and in working with and generating complex abstractions. It helped me develop my skills in researching and documenting in-depth knowledge. It also taught me to practice conceptualization and dedication for long hours, as well as resilience when expected results are not achieved. Thanks to it, I have gained excellent connections and exhaustive knowledge in the field of computer science.
