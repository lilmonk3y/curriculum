# About me

I'm a software developer with web back-end experience and front-end enthusiast. I am currently studying a degree in Computer Science at the University of Buenos Aires. I also have an upper intermediate level of English (CEFR B2); I studied the language for 12 years in my elementary and high school education, and today I find myself working with teams in the United States and Israel where all communication are in this language.

The biggest number of challenges I faced professionally were in back-end web architectures, where I worked with a very wide range of programming languages ​​and frameworks. I am used to working in agile and dynamic environments where the requirements can change to add the greatest value for the users of the products in which I cooperate.

In the last time I find myself taking new challenges in front-end projects. My goal is to have tools to be able to contribute to developments from design to implementation, taking into account the user experience and great performance so that users can enjoy the platforms.

I am passionate about my career, so I did assistantships in my university, such as:
 - Exhibitor at Tecnópolis 2016 - CONICET Stand.
 - Exhibitor at Computing Week 2016 - Computing at Ciudad Universitaria.
 - Exhibitor Night of the Museums 2017 - Computing Stand at Ciudad Universitaria.
